# RHELAB
A script or set of scripts that create a virtual lab to study for the RHCSA test. Based on objectives stated at RHEL certifications pages.
I have diff'd the ldap.conf, sssd.conf, and one of slapd.d config files and hopefully patched up my errors that caused the script to fail on the first test on a new Centos 7 machine.
Please feel free to use this for your own studies. If you decide to use the script on a production machine, be forwarned that I have taken NO steps to validate the security of the installation as the primary use for me will be a lab situation. 
I am in no way asserting what will or will not be included in any examination by Red Hat or any other certification body. I am creating this script to help me study for the Red Hat CSA test based on objectives stated by Red Hat Enterprise Linux for their exams.
